¼ cup unsalted butter

3 Tbsp brewed coffee

1 tsp ground cinnamon

¼ tsp ground cloves

¼ tsp grated orange zest or orange flower water

⅛ tsp salt

½ cup granulated sugar

1 ¾ lbs prepared pizza dough, room temperature


1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.

2. In a small saucepan, melt butter, coffee, cinnamon, cloves, orange zest or flower water and salt until combined. Transfer butter mixture to a small bowl. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat cups of a 12-count non-stick muffin tin with a bit of butter mixture.

3. Add sugar to a dinner plate or pie dish.

4. Use kitchen scissors to snip off bite-size rounds of dough. Roll balls in butter mixture, then coat in sugar and add to prepared muffin cup. Repeat with 2 to 3 more dough balls per muffin cup until entire tin is full. Drizzle any leftover butter mixture over top of muffins.

5. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until buns are dry to the touch and cooked through. Using a butter knife to loosen edges, remove muffins from pan and serve warm.
